Typing is one of my hobbies. However, my typing skills were terrible in middle school, worse in high school, and still not good enough in college.

During that period, I typed sentences over and over again, believing in the adage "practice makes perfect." However, I became aware that my practice approach might not have been the best one. Even though I was getting better at typing, I still wanted more.

After graduating, I revisited the fundamentals, starting with familiarizing myself with the location of each key on the keyboard. I dedicated time every morning, during lunch, and in the evening to become proficient in key positions. Once I had a grasp of each key's location, I began entering brief phrases.

Now, I can type even special characters like % without needing to look at the keyboard. My average words per minute (wpm), which is a basic indicator of typing speed, varies between 70 and 90 with 95% accuracy.

I used the website [typingclub.com](https://www.typingclub.com/) to practice typing. It's not an ad or a support activity.ðŸ˜‚
