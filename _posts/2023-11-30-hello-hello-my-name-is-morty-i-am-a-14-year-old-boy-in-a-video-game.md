I brought this title from the 'Rick and Morty' season 6 episode 2.  

I usually take the subway to work, and during the commute, I enjoy watching the Netflix animated series 'Rick and Morty.'

For those unfamiliar with it, 'Rick and Morty' is an American animated series that bears a resemblance to the movie 'Back to the Future,' as it was influenced by it.

The main characters are Rick and Morty. Rick is a brilliant scientist, albeit with some quirks, and Morty is his grandson. Morty is a bit naive and often finds himself in trouble, but they are always together, navigate through many challenges with humor.  
That's the reason why I like this animation.  

I hope you get a chance to watch 'Rick and Morty' someday.
