Meet Jack Black, not Joe Black.  
I first encountered him in the movie 'School of Rock,' where a rock band singer becomes a substitute teacher and imparts the magic of rock to students.  
I can't remember well, but I think it was really fun to watch.  
Recently, I saw the movie again, and it still brings joy to my ears.  
Anyway, after discovering Jack Black, I watched many more movies with him in it.  
My favorite is 'Tenacious D.'  
If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend giving it a try.  
Let's dive into the world of Jack Black!
