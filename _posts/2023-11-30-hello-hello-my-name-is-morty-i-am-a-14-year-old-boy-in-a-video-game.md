I brought this title from the 'Rick and Morty' season 6 episode 2.

I usually go to work by using a subway.
And I like to watching a Netflix animation 'Rick and Morty' on the way of work.

For the people who don't know about 'Rick and Morty'
It's an animation made in USA.
And It looks like very similar to the movie 'Back to the Future'.
It's because it effected by the movie 'Back to the Future'.

Main character is Rick and Morty
Rick is a very genius scientists. But he is something wrong.
Morty is Rick's grandson. He is little stupid and usually make some trouble.
But they always together and go through the many troubles with fun.
That's the reason why I like this animation.

I hope you to see this animation someday.
