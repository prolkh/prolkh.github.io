Meet Jack Black, not Joe Black.  
I first encountered Jack Black in the movie 'School of Rock.'  
I can't remember well, but I think it was really fun to watch.  
Recently, I saw the movie again, and it still brings joy to my ears.  
Anyway, after I encountered Jack Black, I watched many movies with him in it.  
My favorite Jack Black movie is 'Tenacious D.'  
If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend giving it a try.  
Let's dive into the world of Jack Black!
