Football, often referred to as soccer, is a team sport play with one ball and 22 players.  
The objective is for players to score goals using the ball.  
Since there is only one ball on the field, attention often gravitates towards the player's on-the-ball movements.

Nevertheless, the significance of 'off the ball' movement—those made when a player is not directly engaged with the ball—should not be underestimated. Despite being less noticeable, these off-the-ball actions are crucial and often determine the success of a play.

Observing football games has led me to appreciate that success is not solely dependent on on-the-ball actions. As a result, I have cultivated a strong work ethic, not only during on-the-ball moments but also in off-the-ball scenarios, seizing opportunities to contribute to the team's goals.
