I am currently 30 years old, and I have embarked on the journey of learning English using the book 'Grammar in Use'
Some may argue that it's too late to start learning a new language, but I believe in the proverb 'Better late than never'.
My ultimate goal is to achieve fluency in English, and subsequently, I aspire to secure a job where I can collaborate with people from different nations.
As the saying goes, 'Better late then never,' I will perservere and succeed.
