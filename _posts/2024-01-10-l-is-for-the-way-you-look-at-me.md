L is for the way you look at me,  
O is for the only one I see.  
V is very, very extraordinary,  
E is even more than anyone that you adore can.  

This is a lyrics of Nat King Cole's song 'L-O-V-E.'  
I totally agree with it.  
In my experience, when someone is in love, you can see it in the way their eyes light up.
